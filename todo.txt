Just a running list of things I plan to do for this, so when I lose interest and pick it up again 9 months later I can see what needs to be done. A plus means it's done.

+ Add more IP address finder inputs
+ Implement change control dialog
+ Add (symmetrical) (asymmetrical) to Spiff and Katton respectively
+ Make it work with steam version/multiple versions of Windows
+ Put self in credits
+ Update readme with changes
+ Increase version number
+ Upload .exe to somewhere, possibly Dropbox? PDrive? Or use Github releases

- Use a different UI framework cos this one is really annoying to work with (Qt?)
-- I think I'll do this for the next version, I hate this current framework. I'm going to make version 2.2 workable (if possibly buggy) and then direct my efforts to making a Qt version for 3.0)

- Toggle fullscreen from settings (I think this just requires access to C:\Windows\hegames.ini)
- Be smart about finding .exe path
